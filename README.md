#### This is a webapp created with the purpose of providing college students with extra sets of notes by allowing other college students to open source their own notes. The tech stack that is used on this is Django REST, NodeJS, ExpressJS, React TypeScript, Firebase, and SQLite3. Django has an amazing User Authentication and Searlization libraries with Django REST, and ExpressJS is a very simple backend that I used for tasks like comment section and uploading of notes to NoteHub. Firebase also has a lot of free tools like Firestore and Firebase cloud console which can be used to upload images as links compared to storing images as blobs on realtime database. Storing images as blobs is very time consuming to send to client side and it is inefficient because it takes a lot of resources.
